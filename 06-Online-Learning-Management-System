/*
EXPLANATION OF THE CODE

The code creates a database for an Online Learning Management System with four tables: Courses, Students, Instructors, and Enrollments.
Courses Table: Stores information about courses, including a unique identifier (CourseID), course name, and credits.
Students Table: Stores information about students, including a unique identifier (StudentID), student name, and enrollment date.
Instructors Table: Stores information about instructors, including a unique identifier (InstructorID), instructor name, and hire date.
Enrollments Table: Manages the relationships between students and courses, including a unique identifier (EnrollmentID), student ID, course ID, and enrollment date. This table uses foreign keys to link to the Students and Courses tables.
Inserting Data: Adds sample data into each table to demonstrate how the database might be used.
